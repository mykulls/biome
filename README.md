# cs35l-project

Clone the repository to your local device. Then, to setup your environment, you need 3 initial `npm install`s: once within the root directory, once within client, and once within server.

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

Remember to only commit changes to the proper branch (server or client) and create pull requests to main when completed with a task.
